## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlvoorhis/join-our-newsletter-master/refs/heads/main/ProjectScreenshot.png)

This project gave me experience with HTML forms and proper spacing.


### What I learned

I learned how to create forms in HTML and style them in CSS. I also was able to troubleshoot spacing issues.

### Useful resources
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp - This helped me format the form correctly in CSS.
<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

### Room to grow
I only tackled the desktop version of this challenge. I hope to revisit it once I have learned media queries. Also, the form responses are not stored anywhere, as I was mainly just focused on the design element this attempt.
